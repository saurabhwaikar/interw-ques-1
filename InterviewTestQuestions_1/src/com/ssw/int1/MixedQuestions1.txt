1) in inheritance, if methods are throwing exception, how will they behave?

is below code valid?
/**
* this in context of child class has unchecked exception 
* and parent class have exception
*/
class base {
	public void show() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("base");
	}
}

class child extends base {
	public void show() throws NullPointerException {
		System.out.println("child");
	}
}

2) If inner class is created, who can access inner class's data members ?
	Options: 1) upper class 2) inner class 3) both
3) If inner class is created, who can access inner class's members functions?
	Options: 1) upper class 2) inner class 3) both

4) 
byte a="47";
byte b = 47;
long d = "47";
long e = 47;


if(a==b)
	System.out.println("ab");

if(a==d)
	System.out.println("ad");

if(b==d)
	System.out.println("bd");


5) Can we throw exception of child class (of class bb)?

class aa extends Exception {	
}

class bb extends aa {
}
