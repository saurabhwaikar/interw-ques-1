ClassNotFoundException vs. NoClassDefFoundError

ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError occur when a particular class is not found at runtime. 
However, they occur at different scenarios.

ClassNotFoundException is an exception that occurs when you try to load a class at run time using 
Class.forName() or loadClass() methods and mentioned classes are not found in the classpath.

NoClassDefFoundError is an error that occurs when a particular class is present at compile time, but was 
missing at run time.
